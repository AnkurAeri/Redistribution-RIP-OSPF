# Redistribution-RIP-OSPF


Project Summary: Provision of Advanced Complex Network Architecture and Configuration 
 In this project the author was required to design a number of networks and configure them in order to sufficiently test this complex network design. The first and foremost was to interconnect several subnets using diverse routing protocol, hence facilitating smooth flow of data between different segments of the network. 
 
 Network Architecture 
 Multi sub-net work was developed and two routing protocols used, namely RIP and OSPF. So as to enable communication between these distinct routing domains, there was need to incorporate a redistribution router. 
 
 Configuration and Implementation 
 
 Router Configuration: The routers were given serial numbers with reference to the students’ Identification Codes to promote easy network administration and detection of problems. For all interfaces, static IP addresses were assigned and followed the set network plan. 
 Routing Protocol Implementation: RIP and OSPF routing protocols were implemented separately on each of their networks as it was described above. Redistribution was carried with caution at the headquarters’ router whereby routing information between the two domains was exchanged. 
 
 PC and Server Configuration: Subnet masks were then given to all the client PCs and Server in order to ensure that the client PC’s are able to connect to the network and to the internet. 
 Testing and Verification 
 Various test were performed in order to ensure that all the networks in the system were fully functional. This included: 
 
 Checking OSPF neighbors and to verify the correct route by command of “show ip ospf nei”. 
 Checking network connectivity between all devices by command ‘ping" and "traceroute”. 
 Testing on the Internet via the web server WITH different network segments to rate Internet connection. 
 Outcomes 
 The project was beneficial in showcasing full knowledge on the part of the student on issues to do with the network design, routing protocols and how to diagnose issues affecting the network. Redistribution, that enables integration of different routing domains, has been illustrated quite effectively. Also, the project pointed out that though the elements of a network architecture could easily be purchased off the shelf, fine tuning and integration required a lot of hard work and testing. 
 
 This project becomes a foundation of constructing network engineering expertise, though it embodies introductory network engineering ideas more advanced concepts will be introduced in the next project.
